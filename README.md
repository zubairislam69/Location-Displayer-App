## Overview
This application populates an SQLite database with 50 addresses, latitudes and longitudes on app creation. This is done by using a text file with latitudes and longitudes and using geocoding to get the address. Afterwards, these addresses are seen on the home screen inside a ListView, which is handled by a custom array adapter.
